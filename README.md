# formulation-proof
This is my first attempt that I write the codes of a proof of a consensus protocol using TLA+ so some errors may exist.

# Run the code
Download [TLA toolbox](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html) and add the source code to your own project and then you can run it.
